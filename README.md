FizzBuzz Program
This is a Python program that asks the user to enter a number and prints "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5. If the number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, the program prints the number itself.
